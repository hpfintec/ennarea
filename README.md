## high-level design of a cloud infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (AWS):
1. AWS VPC: Ennarea Mobile Banking would be deployed in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS to ensure secure and isolated network environment.

2. AWS EC2: Ennarea would use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) to host the application servers and web servers. EC2 instances would be configured with necessary software, libraries, and tools required to run the application.

3. AWS RDS: To store the transactional and non-transactional data, Ennarea would use Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) that provides managed relational database services. This would help to offload the database administration tasks and ensure high availability and reliability of the database.

4. AWS S3: To store large amounts of data, Ennarea would use Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for file storage. This would help to store user data, backups, and any other data that needs to be stored for a long time.

5. AWS CloudFront: To provide a faster and secure delivery of the application's web pages, Ennarea would use Amazon CloudFront. CloudFront would distribute the content from EC2 and S3 to the end-users, improving the performance and reducing the load on the servers.

6. AWS Lambda: To run the background processes and perform other tasks, Ennarea would use AWS Lambda. Lambda would help to run the processes without having to provision and manage servers.

7. AWS SNS: To send notifications and alerts to users, Ennarea would use Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). SNS would help to ensure the delivery of notifications and alerts to users, and also manage the delivery of SMS notifications through SMS banking.

8. AWS CloudWatch: To monitor the performance and health of the application and the underlying infrastructure, Ennarea would use Amazon CloudWatch. CloudWatch would provide performance metrics, logging, and alarms to help identify and resolve any issues with the application and infrastructure.


This cloud infrastructure design would provide a scalable, secure, and highly available platform for Ennarea Mobile Banking. By leveraging the AWS services, Ennarea would be able to focus on delivering a high-quality user experience, without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure.


## Conclusion:

Ennarea Mobile Banking is poised to become a key player in the market for digital currencies, with its focus on providing a secure and user-friendly platform for managing CBDCs and stablecoins. The company's combination of innovative app features and functionalities, combined with a comprehensive marketing strategy, will likely make it a popular choice for those looking to manage their digital assets. As the world continues to move towards digitalization, Ennarea is well positioned to meet the growing demand for solutions in this space.
